## Mission 2: UX for depositing & withdrawing funds (writing, UX & UI design)

I don't have much experience with wireframes so I have created HTML modals on Main home page.

## Mission 3: Customer Support (Writing)

### 1. Debugging

1. **Initial Response**

   Begin by expressing regret for any inconvenience and offer assurance that the issue will be addressed. Confirm the user's identity and account details.

2. **Gather Information**

   To better understand the situation, ask a few questions:
   - Can you provide details of the transaction, such as the amount, recipient's bank information, and the transaction time?
   - Is the transaction visible in your bank statement?
   - Does other transaction appeared after the missing one?

3. **Hypotheses**

   Consider potential scenarios that could explain the issue:
   - Delays in transaction processing.
   - Insufficient funds in Dr. V. Horrible's account at the time of the transaction.
   - The possibility of the money being sent to the wrong account.

4. **Falsify Hypotheses**

   To eliminate these hypotheses, conduct the following checks:
   - Examine whether any bank holidays or delays in processing may have caused the delay.
   - Ensure there are no errors in data entry during the payment process.

5. **Diagnosing the Issue**

   After investigating the above hypotheses, proceed with debugging:
   - Check if other users have faced a similar issue recently and review the resolution.
   - Investigate whether there were any production failures or incidents during the transaction.
   - Identify key differences in this customer support issue compared to previous cases.

6. **Communication**

   Maintain open communication with Dr. V. Horrible:
   - Provide updates on the progress made in resolving the issue.
   - Explain the next steps being taken to address the matter.

7. **Collaboration with Other Departments**

   If the issue persists, collaborate with the engineering team responsible for the affected module:
   - Request a search for relevant backend data and transaction logs.
   - If relevant logs or histories are found, Raise it with the data or API team to initiate a thorough investigation and issue resolution.

8. **Final Communication with Dr. V. Horrible**

   Once I have a clear understanding of the issue, reach out to Dr. V. Horrible:
   - Extend apologies for any inconvenience experienced.
   - Provide an update on the issue's resolution.

By following these steps, we aim to effectively address and resolve Dr. V. Horrible's concern.





### 2. Answering the user


Subject: Following up on missing Wire Transfer.

Dear Dr. Horrible,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing today to follow up on the trouble you were having wiring $10,000 to Startup X's account, we have identified a technical issue within our system that resulted in a delay in recognizing your $10,000 wire transfer. The wire transfer was, in fact, received, but due to an unexpected bug in our code, it was incorrectly filtered out during our transaction history cleaning process. Unfortunately, this issue persisted for a week, leading to the unintended closure of your deal.

I wish to extend our sincere apologies for the confusion, inconvenience, and the regrettable delay that regrettably led to your missed investment opportunity. We fully acknowledge the frustration and disappointment this situation has caused you.

In an effort to make amends for the inconvenience you've experienced, we have taken the following steps:

We will wire the full amount back to your source account, along with an additional 5% as compensation for the inconvenience and the missed opportunity resulting from our error. The total amount wired back to you will now be $10,500. You can expect the funds to be credited to your account within 2-3 business days.

Furthermore, we are pleased to inform you that your account has been upgraded to premium status. This enhancement will entitle you to priority customer service support around the clock, ensuring a swift and efficient resolution of any future issues you may encounter while conducting business with us.

Once again, we deeply regret the disruption this incident has caused, and we remain committed to providing you with a superior banking experience going forward.

Sincerely,
Shekhar Patil
